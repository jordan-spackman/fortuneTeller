      <h3>What is I CHING?</h3>
        <p>The I Ching or "Book of Changes" is the most famous of the Chinese classics.
          One of the oldest surviving relics of written language, it's earliest editions date back to almost 2800 BCE. 
          A book of philosophy, ethics, and history, it has influenced almost all world culture and religion. 
          It has been used as a divinition tool for centuries by emperors of China and Confusion scholars, seeing a modern western rivival begining in the 1950s.
          As a system for predicting the future the I-Ching might disappoint, but as a way of questioning your own unconscious mind it can be remarkably useful.
